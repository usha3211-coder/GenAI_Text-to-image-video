Standard Libraries:

pandas: Enables efficient data manipulation and analysis in tabular form (often used for data preprocessing and postprocessing).
Deep Learning Libraries:
transformers: Provides pre-trained transformer models (like T5, BART) for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, potentially used for text generation in Open-Sora.
timm: Offers a collection of pre-trained image models (e.g., EfficientNet, ViT) for computer vision tasks, potentially used for image manipulation or generation within Open-Sora (less likely than transformers).
torchvision (assumed, not explicitly listed): Likely used for computer vision tasks like image loading, transformation, and augmentation, possibly for data preparation in Open-Sora.
torch (assumed, not explicitly listed): The core PyTorch library for building and training deep learning models.

Other Libraries:

tqdm: Provides progress bars for visualizing the training or inference process, enhancing user experience.
wandb (optional): A cloud-based platform for experiment tracking, logging, and visualization, potentially used for monitoring Open-Sora's training performance.
