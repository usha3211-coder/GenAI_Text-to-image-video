Libraries Used in Lumiere and their Functionalities:

1. Torch:
 The foundation for defining the Lumiere model architecture, performing computations, and training the network.
2. Einops:
 Enables efficient handling of video data (tensors with additional time dimension) by reshaping, packing/unpacking features across time steps, and repeating information for temporal modules.
3. Beartype:
Improves code maintainability and reduces errors by enforcing type annotations on function arguments and return values.
4. x-transformers:
Implements attention mechanisms for learning relationships between features across different parts of the video sequence.
5. Optree:
Potentially used for flattening intermediate model outputs or unpacking data for specific operations.

Optional Libraries:

copy: Used for deep copying the text-to-image model before modifying it in Lumiere.
math: Used for mathematical operations like calculating square root (sqrt) in normalize_weight.
functools: Offers decorator functions for modifying existing functions in Lumiere (e.g., @residualize).
torch.nn: Provides various building blocks for constructing neural networks, like convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling layers (used for the projection head in MPAttentionInflationBlock).
torch.nn.functional (F): Offers functional implementations of common neural network operations used in the code (e.g., F.linear, F.conv2d, F.silu).

Functionality Specific to MP(magnitude-preserving) Modules:

l2norm: Performs L2 normalization across a specified dimension, crucial for weight normalization in MP linear and convolutional layers.
normalize_weight: Normalizes the weights of a linear or convolutional layer using L2 norm and scales it by the appropriate factor for magnitude preservation.
interpolate_1d: Upsamples or downsamples a 1D tensor (representing the time dimension in video data) using a specified interpolation mode (e.g., bilinear).
MPSiLU: Implements the modified SiLU activation function used in the paper.
Gain: A simple module that scales the input by a learnable gain parameter.
MPAdd: Implements the magnitude-preserving addition operation used for combining residuals with outputs from MP convolutional or attention blocks.
MPAttention: Defines a multi-head attention module with MP weight normalization and dropout for video processing.
MPTemporalDownsample and MPTemporalUpsample: Modules for downsampling and upsampling the temporal dimension of video data using 1D convolutions with appropriate initialization (e.g., Dirac delta for downsampling).
MPConvolutionInflationBlock: Combines a spatial convolutional layer, a temporal convolutional layer with MP weight normalization, and a projection head for processing video data with MP modules.
MPAttentionInflationBlock: Stacks multiple MP attention layers with residual connections and dropout for video processing.
