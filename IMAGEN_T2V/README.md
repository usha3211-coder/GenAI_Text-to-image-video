Imagen Video is a diffusion model that was developed by Google AI. It is capable of generating high-quality videos with complex compositions. However, it can be computationally expensive to use and can sometimes produce videos that are not realistic.
Text conditional video generation system based on a cascade of video diffusion models
Given a text prompt, it generates high defination videos using a base video generation model and a sequence of interleaved spatial and temporal cideo super resolution models.
