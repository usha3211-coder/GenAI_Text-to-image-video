# IMAGEN T2V
  Is a diffusion model that was developed by Google AI. It is capable of generating high-quality videos with complex compositions. However, it can be computationally expensive to use and can sometimes produce videos that are not realistic.
* Text conditional video generation system based on a cascade of video diffusion models.
* Given a text prompt, it generates high defination videos using a base video generation model and a sequence of interleaved spatial and temporal cideo super resolution models.

# Explanation of Blocks:

* Text Input: User provides a textual description of the desired video.
* T5-XXL Encoder: The pre-trained T5-XXL model encodes the text into a numerical representation.
* conditional Video Diffusion: The encoded text becomes the conditioning input for the Video U-Net diffusion model,  generating a low-resolution video. This model uses temporal attention for long-term dependencies.
* Spatial Super-Resolution (SSR) Stages: There can be multiple SSR stages. Each stage uses a U-Net architecture with spatial attention and convolutions (earlier stages) or fully convolutional models (later stages) for memory efficiency. Bilinear resizing is used for upsampling.
* Temporal Super-Resolution (TSR): This stage uses temporal convolutions (instead of attention) to increase frame rate for smoother motion while maintaining local temporal consistency. The low-resolution video and text embedding are combined as inputs.
* Progressive Distillation (Optional): This step can be used to create faster models for quicker generation without significant quality loss.
* Classifier-Free Guidance: Applied throughout the process to ensure the generated video aligns with the text prompt.
* Output Video: The final high-resolution video corresponding to the user's input.
