# Text Preprocessing:

* Tokenization: The text description is split into individual words or phrases (tokens).
* Text Embedding: Each token (or the entire description depending on the implementation) is converted into a numerical representation using a pre-trained text encoder, like T5 XXL based on Imagen's findings. This creates a text embedding that captures the semantic meaning of the text. 

# Imagen Architecture Breakdown:

1. 64x64 Image Diffusion Model:

* This initial stage utilizes a diffusion process to generate a low-resolution image:
Starts with Gaussian noise (random data) generated from a Gaussian distribution. (Block Diagram: Random Noise)
* Progressively removes noise through multiple steps, iteratively refining the image based on the following:
* Classifier-free guidance: The model is trained on both conditional (text-guided) and unconditional (unguided) image generation to prevent overfitting. (Block Diagram: Classifier Free Guidance)
* Conditioning with Text Embeddings:
A pooled embedding vector, representing the overall meaning of the text, is added to the diffusion timestep embedding. 
Cross-attention is applied over the text embeddings at multiple resolutions to focus on relevant parts of the description at different image generation scales.
Employs thresholding techniques (static or dynamic) to prevent oversaturation of pixel values during image generation.

2. Cascaded Diffusion for High-Resolution Images: (256x256, 1024x1024)
   
* After the 64x64 image is generated, Imagen utilizes cascaded diffusion models to achieve higher resolutions:
The 64x256 diffusion model upsamples the 64x64 image to 256x256 resolution. (Block Diagram: 64x256 Super Resolution Diffusion Model)
The 256x1024 diffusion model further upsamples the image to 1024x1024 resolution. (Block Diagram: 256x1024 Super Resolution Diffusion Model)
These upsampling models also use diffusion processes conditioned on the text embedding to ensure the higher-resolution image remains faithful to the description.

Output:

The final outcome is a high-resolution image (1024x1024) that corresponds to the text description.
